# chatbot_me: fine-tuning an AI to talk like me!

Hi hi! I had already created some documentation of my process so I can easily replicate it, so I decided to flush it out to talk more about the process I took! Ultra-inspired by [quinnai](https://www.quinnha.xyz/quinn-ai), so check em out :)

To use, simply download the .ipynb file and follow the instructions -- all data collection and fine-tuning tools are listed there. Reading the (OpenAI Quickstart Guide)[https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart] or messing around in the (Playground)[https://platform.openai.com/playground] can be super useful (and fun).

In the future, I'm looking to integrate this with a mini messaging interface with some other features on the website, so keep a lookout!
